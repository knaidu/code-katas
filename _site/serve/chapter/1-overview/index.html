<h2 id='1_overview'>1. Overview</h2>

<p>There were some important choices that had to be made in writing the book. This is a chapter dedicated to justifying some of these decisions.</p>

<h3 id='why_ruby'>Why Ruby?</h3>

<p>There are hundreds of programming languages out there. So why should you program in Ruby?</p>

<p>Programmers have different preferences and styles of programming. Depending on programmers&#8217; values and experiences, programmers can aptly give reasons why they think people should choose certain programming language. Although programmers may like different languages for different reasons, their opinions are usually correct in identifying why certain programming languages are great for certain uses. This is because programming languages have identifiable characteristics programmers can point to and compare with one another.</p>

<p>I like to program in Ruby because Ruby is <em>succinct</em> and highly <em>practical</em> language that is <em>widely used</em> by many programmers in the industry.</p>

<p>Ruby codes are succint and highly readable. This is an opinion that&#8217;s commonly shared among non-Ruby programmers as well. Even with minimal programming experience, you&#8217;ll be able to read and understand elementary Ruby codes. In many ways, this characteristic carries over to more complex Ruby codes too. There are some unusual syntaxes that are unique to Ruby, but once you understand what they do, you&#8217;ll be able to read and understand complex Ruby code like you&#8217;d do with simple Ruby code. Like reading code, writing code feels more straight forward and even enjoyable.</p>

<p>Ruby has powerful programming language features that lets you write functional programs with less code. Just ask thousands of developers using <a href='http://rubyonrails.org/'>Ruby on Rails</a> to build applications serving millions of users everyday. Writing code in Ruby will improve your productivity.</p>

<p>Ruby is a popular language. Its popularity exploded since Ruby on Rails was introduced in 2004. Beginners will have an easier time getting help thanks to large <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby'>Ruby community on StackOverflow</a>. Your coding skills in Ruby will also be useful in finding a career as a developer as well. There are plenty of companies looking for Ruby developers.</p>

<h3 id='how_about_c_and_java'>How About C++ and Java?</h3>

<p>C++ and Java are popular programming languages of choice for data structures and algorithms courses in university. C++ and Java are fast programming language. By &#8220;fast&#8221; I mean, if you had a program written in C++ or Java that does same things as a program written in Ruby, the program written in C++ or Java will have more executions per given time.</p>

<p>C++ and Java are also more popular than Ruby. There are more C++ or Java programmers than Ruby programmers. There are more companies looking for C++ or Java programmers as well.</p>

<p>On the other hand, demonstrating high level concepts in data structures and algorithms with Ruby is more suitable as Ruby is packed with higher-order functions like map, block, closures and others. This means several practical benefits for a programmer. Since there are less things to manage by the programmer with powerful higher-order functions in Ruby, the programmer will tend to make less mistakes. The programmer will likely be more productive with higher-order functions because you can express more with less code.</p>

<p>Utilizing such a high level programming such as Ruby comes with the price of nothing being able to present some important concepts in lower level programming languages such as memory management. C++ and Java certainly are not poor choice for university courses.</p>

<p>This book chose Ruby as the programming language of choice because of the emphasis placed on actually implementing all the data structures and algorithms to be presented in the book. You can certainly use C++ or Java to do the same, but it likely will require more time and effort to do so in comparison to Ruby.</p>

<h3 id='code_vs_pseudocode'>Code vs. Pseudocode</h3>

<p>The book encourages implementing various algorithms in the book. Actually coding the algorithms provides different sort of experience than simply reading the book. As the readers code, they will gain different insights in algorithms which the book alone cannot provide.</p>

<p>There are many books that utilize pseudocode to lay out the steps to implement algorithms. Pseudocode has an advantage over code in providing the reader a clear conceptual path towards implementing algorithm in various programming languages.</p>

<p>With that said, the undeniable benifit of being able to run the code readily trumped using pseudocode in the book. And as you become more comfortable with Ruby, reading Ruby code will become much easier than reading pseudocode.</p>

<h3 id='setting_up_ruby_development_environment'>Setting Up Ruby Development Environment</h3>

<h4 id='mac_os_x'>Mac OS X</h4>

<p>Ruby versions 1.8 and 1.9 are currently in wide use. We will use Ruby version 1.9.3 specifically and we will use <a href='https://rvm.io/'>RVM</a> to manage multiple Ruby versions.</p>

<h5 id='step_1_check_ruby_version'>Step 1: Check Ruby Version</h5>

<p>Open Terminal and run this command to check the current version of Ruby install on the computer.</p>

<p><code>ruby -v</code></p>

<p>The Ruby version is most likely 1.8.7. OS X comes preinstalled with Ruby 1.8.7. If it is 1.9.3 by any chance, you are off the hook. You can skip the rest of the steps and move onto the next chapter. If the Ruby version is 1.8.7, follow step 2.</p>

<h5 id='step_2_install_git'>Step 2: Install Git</h5>

<p>Let&#8217;s check if git is installed on your machine.</p>

<p><code>git --version</code></p>

<h5 id='step_3_install_xcode'>Step 3: Install Xcode</h5>

<h5 id='step_4_install_rvm'>Step 4: Install RVM</h5>

<p>Follow the installation guide provided in the <a href='https://rvm.io/rvm/install/'>RVM website</a> to install Ruby.</p>
